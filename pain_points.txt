Paint Points in Process:

-Text does not cleanly copy paste
-All tables must be manually made
-All headings and Styles must be manually made
-Equations must be manually inputted

Ideal Automated Tool:

Structural Automation:
-Automatically detect headings and apply correct word styles (Done?)
-Auto Generate TOC/List of tables
    -(Partially done, have to manually use word to create the reference but it will auto populate. Low amount of time to do manually.)

Table Extraction:
-Identify Tables in PDF
-Recreate Tables with correct formatting maintained

Figures/Equations:
-Identify figures/Equations
-Flag by writing name / "Add Equation" in red

Formatting Rules:
-Apply standard paragraph, spacing, and indent Rules
-Clean up rouge styles (I don't think we can do this VIA the OCR results)
-Enforce template formatting requirements

QC Flags:
-Highlight sections where the program is uncertain
